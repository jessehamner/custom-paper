# Custom Paper Templates in LaTeX

These pages are a collection of [LaTeX](http://tug.org/) documents that I have written, modified, 
or borrowed from open source / shared sources. I made or acquired them because
they "scratched an itch", and are provided here in hopes others find them
useful. The [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) documentation preparation system is enormously capable and
does a great job with document layout, tables, mathematical typesetting, and 
programmatic graphics. It has a gigantic set of useful add-ons that are worth
the effort to learn.


## Component Pages
These pages are meant to work with the Adafruit SMD component binders; 
the labels line up horizontally with the narrow pocket pages. I use a lot
of SMD components and writing out the information gets tedious and can be
error-prone, both writing and reading back out.

These pages are commercially available as "Filofax personal" sized 
and are punched to the same specs as the Adafruit binder. 
Filofax personal pages are 95mm x 171mm, which is not a standard size, I think.
Searching for 'B132451' or "Filofax personal plain white" should produce
usable results for purchasing the packages, and should be less than USD $10
Then, one can print these pages as normal from "tray 1" or the "accessory tray" 
of a printer.


## Cornell-Ruled Paper
[Cornell-ruled paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes) is a 
[great take on analog note-taking](https://lifehacker.com/5611648/diy-ultimate-note-taking-notebook), 
but commercial
sources of the paper are very expensive -- so much so that printing the paper
yourself is actually economically viable, especially in the occasional 
quantities that most of us need. I have provided three types of Cornell-ruled
sheets -- blank, college-ruled, and quad-ruled graph paper.

You can also download templates from [other sources](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21AEhczXB516sbYw0&id=69A3B453BFBC472%211130&cid=069A3B453BFBC472) 
online, though a [few of them](https://www.honolulu.hawaii.edu/sites/www2.honolulu.hawaii.edu/files/care-resource-notes-template.pdf) 
have room for improvement.


## College-Ruled Paper
Completely generic US-letter sized paper with slightly narrower line spacing than usually found. 


## Popcorn Accounting
Cub scouts sell popcorn to raise funds. Sometimes they work at a specific
commercial location like a restaurant or store, and they work in shifts. To
better enable record-keeping and to speed up the handoffs among groups at
"shift change", I made an accounting sheet that, I think, covers all aspects
of logistics and financial accounting for each shift change. 


## Graph Paper
2mm graph paper, with 2cm major divisions, and a nice, light, thin green line
background, such that the lines do not compete with pencil lines when 
actually making a graph for, say, math homework, or raster graphics layout, or
whatever.


## Hex Paper
I found this paper online and it's really neat. As an occasional boardgamer,
hex paper is always useful (as is graph paper, of course).


## My Breaker Box
If you own a house, and you have a label on your house breaker panel (sometimes
called a "fuse box"), there is a significant chance the labels are inaccurate 
or entirely unhelpful. If you have recently moved in to the house, even if the
labels are correct and detailed enough to be useful, you may use the rooms
differently than the previous owners / occupants. I bought a house and the
breaker panel label was nearly all labeled "plugs and lights", which, of course,
is worse than unhelpful.

I made my own, standard-sized, template for keeping better records of what all
is affected by each breaker. Some are easy (electric cook tops should always 
be on dedicated two-gang circuits, e.g.). Others, at least, in my house, are
arbitrarily complex and perhaps badly architected. I'm not going to re-run 
hundreds of feet of 12-gauge Romex, but I would like to know what will be 
affected when I do shut off a breaker.
